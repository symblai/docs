Any explicit question or request for information that comes up during the conversation, whether answered or not, is recognized as a question.

#### Examples

- *‚ÄúWhat features are most relevant for our use case?‚Äù*
- *‚ÄúHow are we planning to design the systems?‚Äù*

## Key Features 

- Recognition of questions pointed to someone.
- Recognition of implicit questions.
- Recognition of questions that are actionable in nature.
- Ignoring chit chats - which are questions in nature but part of casual small- talks.

## Questions API

To see the Questions API in action, you need to process a conversation using Symbl. After you process a meeting, you'll receive a **Conversation ID** which is passed in Conversation API. A Conversation ID is the key to receiving conversational insights from any conversation. As an example, here's a simple API call which grabs the detected questions from the conversation.

üëâ [Questions API](/docs/conversation-api/questions)

### Grab Questions 

Remember to replace the `conversationId` in the API call with the Conversation ID you get from the previous API call.
