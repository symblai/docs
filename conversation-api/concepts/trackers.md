Trackers allow you to track the occurrence of certain key words or phrases in a conversation so you can identify emerging trends and gauge the nature of interactions. You can define keywords or phrases in a Tracker and Symbl will return messages that contain the same or contextually similar phrases. 

One of the biggest challenges of tracking key words or phrases in natural human conversations is that individuals may be talking about the same thing but may not use the exact key word or phrase defined. 
For example, “I don’t have any money” is contextually similar to “I ran out of budget” as both represent similar inherent meaning.

Symbl removes that complexity by reading into contexts and returning messages that are not only an exact match of the key words or phrases that you have defined but are also closely or contextually similar. Further, the `offset` parameter shows you the extent to which the match has occured with the tracking keywords. 

Using these insights you can introduce process improvements and strategies that align with your business goals.

#### Examples
The tracker names used in the example below are only for explanatory purposes. You can create any tracker for your usecase and assign any name you like.

- *Sandra is the training head of the Sales team in her company. She uses the insights from the **Intro Tracker** to look at how great sales agents start conversations and **Pricing Tracker** to understand how they share the pricing details. She then uses these insights to train other agents.* 
*The **Intro Tracker** Sandra uses tracks contextually similar phrases such as:*<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*"Thank you for taking some time to speak with me"*,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*"Have you ever noticed”*,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*“Have you ever considered”*.<br/>


- *Tom is the Chief Quality Assurance Manager and wants to see how many agents are using negative phrases on the customer calls. He gets insights from the **Negative Phrases Tracker** by tracking the following contextually similar phases:*<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*“I am not interested”*,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*“This makes me uncomfortable”*,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*“Not so good”*,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*“I am skeptical”*,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*“My only problem is”*,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*“My only issue is”*,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*“This does not fit”*.<br/>


- *Samuel uses insights from **Leads Tracker** for all the dial out calls at his car insurance company. By tracking phrases that show buying intent, enquiry about policy options, quotes, discounts, etc., he generates more leads for his business. The **Leads Tracker** tracks the following contextually similar phrases:*<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *“I need”*,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*“Policy options”*,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*“Require”*,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*“Use case”*,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*“Fits our requirement”*,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*“Quotes”*,<br/>
&nbsp; *“Discounts”*.

### Tracker consumption with Management API 

The Trackers APIs can be consumed via the [Management API](/docs/management-api/introduction), which takes the onus of maintaining these entities from the developer and shifts it to Symbl’s backend. The Management API provides an easy-to-consume REST interface for managing these entities.
