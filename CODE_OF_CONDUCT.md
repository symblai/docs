# Code of Conduct 

We love open-sourcing since we can connect and collaborate with enthusiasts all over the world and bring in new perspectives. We welcome everyone to participate in improving our docs and increasing its impact. Be it a documentation edit or pointing out an error, we need to be mindful of our community members while doing so and avoid hurting sentiments or creating friction. 

This code of conduct applies to only issues and pull requests for the Symbl docs repo. 

Given below are some guidelines to keep in mind while contributing to our docs and becoming a part of our interactions with community participants. 

### Clarity
Keep contributions clear and complete. All the improvement suggestions should encourage inspired action rather than merely pointing out vague inconsistencies that do not have a clear output. Weâ€™d love for you to follow the format of the issues template that captures essential information required for us to take clear action. 

### Consideration 
The open-source community is by nature diverse in geography, culture, ethnicity, and language, so remember to be mindful in addressing people of different nationalities, races, and cultural backgrounds. We want to build a community of inclusiveness and oneness. 

### Patience
While we deploy changes from `develop` to master on a weekly basis, there may be unprecedented delays due to internal reviews and technical validations. Under such circumstances, remember to be patient and always give collaborators a reasonable turnaround time. 

### Respect
In a collaborative environment, oftentimes we are faced with disagreements and conflicts. When faced with such a situation, refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior. Use kind and respectful words while putting forth your points and cordially address conflicting ideas from other participants. 

We hope you adhere to these guidelines and help our open source community operate smoothly and frictionlessly.
