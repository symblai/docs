##  Handing Device Change
You can update an audio source during a live stream by using the `updateAudioDevice` method. This method allows you to change devices mid-stream (i.e., laptop microphone to the headset microphone) without stopping or closing the connection. Under normal circumstances would access the `audioStream` object from your [StreamingAPIConnection](/docs/web-sdk/web-sdk-reference/web-sdk-reference/#streamingapiconnection-class) instance.

```js
connection.audioStream.updateAudioDevice(deviceId);
```

Check out the [SDK Reference](/web-sdk/web-sdk-reference/web-sdk-reference/#updateaudiodevicedeviceid-string-mediastream-mediastream) for more information about `updateAudioDevice`
