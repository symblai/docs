 Pre-Built UI is an **interface for the user to interact** with the Symbl's APIs output and understand the conversation better. You can interact with speech-to-text transcription, action items, follow-ups, topics and other APIs. You can generate these API with a simple API call using Experience API after you have processed a conversation using any above-mentioned APIs.
