What is an API?
An application program interface, or API, is an interface that allows for communication between applications over the Internet. This may be an app communicating with a server or servers communicating with servers.

Companies set up an API endpoint to allow developers to deliver information to a server. The server then changes the information and, after the information is changed, the server returns a response to the request.

An API companies’ product is often no more than a product that is designed to perform a specific action or make a single change to information developers send or receive from a server.

In other words, what an API allows you to do is add functionality to a program easily, without having to create that functionality from scratch (in Symbl’s case, we make it possible to add AI to video streaming platforms, among other things).
