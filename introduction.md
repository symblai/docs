## ❇️ Explore our APIs

### 💻  Streaming API
Streaming API is based on Web Socket protocol and is used for **real-time** use-cases where both the audio and its results are available in real-time. It can be integrated directly via the **browser or server**.<br/>

### 🎥  Async API
Async APIs provide the functionality for processing ** stored recordings audio/video** from files or public/signed URLs or textual content from a conversation.<br/>

### 📞 Telephony API
Based on **PSTN and SIP protocols**, this API provides an interface for the developers to have **Symbl join VoIP calls** and get the results back in real-time as well. Optionally, the developer can also trigger an email at the end of the conversation containing the URL to view the transcription, insights, and topics in a single page web application.<br/>

### 📊 Pre-Built UI
Pre-Built UI is an **interface for the user to interact** with the Symbl's APIs output and understand the conversation better. You can interact with speech-to-text transcription, action items, follow-ups, topics and other APIs. You can generate these API with a simple API call using Experience API after you have processed a conversation using any above-mentioned APIs.
